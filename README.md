# Automatic geocode integration for google form

By default Google Form doesn't have the feature to collect user location data when a form get submitted. So what this script does is it add the device(mobile/browser) location data in a google form. User needs to click the confirmation link which shows up after hitting the submit button of the google form. 

The Geocode data consists of 3 columns: 
 1. Timestamp
 2. longitude & latitude
 3. Address (Using reverse geocode)

Note: Therefore for red font data you may want to check manually after completion for correct geodata entry.
