# geocoder-for-google-form
The script will add device geocode data in last submit data row by clicking the link on confirmation page that shows up after hitting the submit button
 geocode data here consists of 3 columns : time to click the link, longitude & latitude and address (using reverse geocode)
 as long as clicking the link is done before next respondent submit button, data will be entered in the right row.
 Therefore for red font data you may want to check manually after completion for correct geodata entry. In the questionnaire add question about address to help checking.
